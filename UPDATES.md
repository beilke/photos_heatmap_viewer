# Python Photo Heatmap Project Update

## Changes Made

The following improvements have been made to the photo processor container:

1. **Fixed Python Path Detection**:
   - The system now dynamically finds the correct Python executable path at runtime
   - Added verification and fallback mechanisms if the primary Python path fails
   - This ensures compatibility across different container environments

2. **Improved Cron Job Formatting**:
   - All cron jobs now use proper bash -c wrappers to ensure command execution works correctly
   - Fixed issues with quotes and escaping in command strings
   - Added working directory (cd /app) to ensure consistent execution context

3. **Enhanced Initial Processing**:
   - Added better error handling for initial database setup
   - Fixed hardcoded Python paths that caused "not found" errors
   - Added more detailed logging for troubleshooting

4. **Unified Python Environment**:
   - The same Python interpreter is now used for both initial processing and scheduled jobs
   - This eliminates inconsistencies between initial setup and ongoing processing

## Cleaned Up Files

The following temporary files have been removed as they are no longer needed:
- fix_cron_format.sh
- fix_cron_jobs.sh
- test_process.sh
- CRON_FIX.md

## Testing

The system has been tested and verified to work correctly in the following scenarios:
1. First-time execution with no existing database
2. Scheduled cron job execution for multiple libraries
3. Execution across container restarts

## Monitoring

To monitor the system's operation, check the following log files:
- `/app/logs/cron_test.log` - Verify cron is running
- `/app/logs/cron_[library_name].log` - Check processing results for specific libraries
