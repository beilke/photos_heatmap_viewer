## Project Structure

- `init_db.py` - Initialize the SQLite database
- `process_photos.py` - Process photos and extract metadata
- `server.py` - Web server for the heatmap viewer
- `index.html` - Web interface for the heatmap
- `manage_libraries.ps1` - Library management script
- `quickstart.ps1` - Quick setup for single-library usage
- `demo_multi_library.ps1` - Demo script showing multiple library setup

## Implementation Details

- Photos are stored with library references in the SQLite database
- Each photo has associated marker data for efficient display
- Photos are automatically clustered for better performance with large datasets
- The web interface efficiently loads only necessary data when zooming/panning
