# Cron Job Fix Notes

This update addresses issues where cron jobs and initial photo processing in the photo-heatmap-processor container were not executing properly.

## Problems

1. Cron jobs were failing with errors like:
   - `/bin/bash: line 1: root: command not found`
   - `/bin/bash: line 1: /usr/bin/python: No such file or directory`

2. Initial processing was failing with:
   - `/app/process_libraries.sh: 33: /usr/bin/python: not found`
   - `WARNING: Database file was not created. Check for errors above.`

## Solution

The following changes have been made to fix these issues:

1. Modified `process_libraries.sh` in the Dockerfile to:
   - Find the correct Python path at the start, before any processing happens
   - Use the same Python path for both initial processing and cron jobs
   - Add better error handling for the initial processing
   - Add proper working directory and command formatting for cron jobs

2. Added `fix_cron_format.sh` script that:
   - Fixes the format of cron jobs to properly use `bash -c` for command execution
   - Makes sure working directory is set correctly (`cd /app`)
   - Properly escapes quotes in the command
   - Fixes any hardcoded Python paths in the script

3. Modified the Dockerfile to:
   - Include the fix script in the image
   - Use proper Python path detection and validation

4. Updated entry.sh to:
   - Run the fix script after process_libraries.sh

## Testing

After rebuilding the image with `publish_to_dockerhub.sh`, the cron jobs should execute properly.
To verify the fix is working, check:
- `/app/logs/cron_test.log` - Should show successful test executions
- `/app/logs/cron_[library_name].log` - Should show successful processing

## Debug Information

If issues persist:
1. Check Python executable path:
   ```
   docker exec photo-heatmap-processor which python3
   ```

2. Check cron configuration:
   ```
   docker exec photo-heatmap-processor cat /etc/cron.d/process_photos
   ```

3. Run processing manually to verify it works:
   ```
   docker exec -it photo-heatmap-processor bash -c "cd /app && $(docker exec photo-heatmap-processor which python3) /app/process_photos.py --process [path] --library [name] --db /app/data/photo_library.db"
   ```
